# Exporting

BatchGenie streamlines the export of your assets, making it easy to organize your library or share them with others. Exporting is done through the BatchGenie main panel in the `3D Viewport` or via the Asset Browser under `BatchGenie > Misc > Export`.

### Via the BatchGenie panel

        - **Objects NOT marked as Assets**: Objects in the your file that are NOT marked as Assets.
        - **All objects**: All objects in the your file regardless if they are marked as Assets or not.

=== "Collections"
    - **Selection**: Allows you to specify which collections to include in Export:
        - **Selected collection**: Choose the currently selected collection in your scene.
        - **Collections marked as Assets**: Collections in the your file that are marked as Assets.
        - **Collections NOT marked as Assets**: Collections in the your file that are NOT marked as Assets.
        - **All collections**: All objects in the your file regardless if they are marked as Assets or not.

- **Format**: Currently only **.Blend** files are supported.
- **Directory**: Choose a directory to export to. The exported files will be named after the object names.
- **Keep Outliner Hierarchy** (Objects only): When enabled, this option ensures that the exported objects follow the structure seen in Blenderâ€™s Outliner. Directories are created to match the hierarchy of objects, placing them in subfolders based on their relationships within the Outliner. Collections without any objects are excluded from this process to keep the structure clean.

- **Overwrite existing files**: Enable this to overwrite existing files with the same name in the selected folder.


### Settings

- **Pack Textures**: Pack all associated textures into their respective blend files, ensuring that your assets maintain their appearance without relying on external texture files
- **Modify Export Filename**: Customize the file names by adding a prefix (characters added before the name) and/or a suffix (characters added after the name). These can be defined in two ways:
    - **Custom**: Allows you to enter any custom characters of your choice.
    - **Asset Type**: Automatically appends the asset type (e.g., Object, Material, Collection) to the name for easier identification.
- **Asset status**:
    - **Keep current**: Keeps current Asset status.
    - **Mark as Asset**: Marks the Exported items as Assets, making them easily accessible in Blender's Asset Browser for future use.
    - **Clear Asset**: Clears the Asset mark.
- **Add Metadata**: Description, License, Copyright & Author

!!! info2  "Materials Use Fake User"
    Materials will have 'use fake user' activated if they are not marked as assets to prevent them from being automatically removed when the exported file is saved.


### Via Asset Browser



If you're exporting via the Asset Browser, you'll see settings similar to those in the main panel, displayed alongside the file browser view where you select the export directory, as shown in the image:
