!!! info2 "Updates"
    BatchGenie respects your privacy. It operates offline and does not collect any data. Therefore, there is no auto-update functionality within the add-on. For updates, simply download the updated add-on manually from the store where you purchased it, uninstall the old version and reinstall the new using the same steps outlined in the instructions above.

### Finding BatchGenie and Using the Documentation

BatchGenie is located in the N-Panel inside the `3D Viewport` under a tab named `BatchGenie`, as shown in the image below. Alternatively, you can place it under the `Tool` tab by changing this setting in the Preferences.
