### Installation

To start using BatchGenie, you need to install the add-on in Blender. Follow these steps:

1. Download the BatchGenie add-on zip file from the store you purchased it from.
2. Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences`.
3. In the Preferences window, navigate to the `Add-ons` tab.
4. Locate the `Add-ons Settings` (:octicons-chevron-down-12: icon) in the top right corner.
5. Click on `Install from Disk` and select the downloaded BatchGenie zip file.

!!! info2 "Updates"
    BatchGenie respects your privacy. It operates offline and does not collect any data. Therefore, there is no auto-update functionality within the add-on. For updates, simply download the updated add-on manually from the store where you purchased it, uninstall the old version and reinstall the new using the same steps outlined in the instructions above.


### Finding BatchGenie and Using the Documentation

BatchGenie is located in the N-Panel inside the `3D Viewport` under a tab named `BatchGenie`, as shown in the image below. Alternatively, you can place it under the `Tool` tab by changing this setting in the Preferences.
