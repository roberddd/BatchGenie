<h5>Settings</h5>

- **Type**:
    - **All Unconnected Nodes**
    - **Image Texture Nodes**
    - **BatchGenie Imported Textures**: Materials imported by BatchGenie that contain textures which could not be connected. See more [details here](import_textures.md/#faq) about these nodes.
- **Highlight Nodes**: Changes the color of the found nodes to red, making them easier to spot visually.

<h5>Instructions</h5>

!!! abstract inline end "Example"
    ![Unconnected Textures Example](images/utility_find_unconnected_nodes_example.png){ .img-box .on-glb }

After clicking `Search`, the interface will display a list of all found materials with unconnected nodes. There are three main approaches to handle the issues: **Automatic**, **Manual**, and **Hybrid**.

`Automatic Approach`

:   Use the `Delete Nodes` button to automatically remove all unconnected nodes from materials in the list. You can remove materials from the list if you wish to exclude them from the batch change before clicking the button. No further actions are required.

`Manual Approach`

:   1. Use either the `Assign to Object` button or the `Auto Assign` toggle to assign materials to the selected object:
        - `Assign to Object`: Click to manually assign the selected material.
        - `Auto Assign`: Automatically assigns materials as you select them from the list.
    - Access the material in the 'Shader Editor' to inspect and address issues by reconnecting or removing nodes as needed.
    - Use the `Remove from List` button (:material-minus: icon) to remove materials after resolving issues.
    - Once all materials are addressed and removed, perform a new search to confirm all issues are fixed.

`Hybrid Approach`

:   Mix manual inspection with the automatic process:

    1. Use `Assign to Object` or `Auto Assign` to inspect materials.
    - Verify that unconnected nodes can be safely removed. If not, remove the material from the list to prevent unintended deletions.
    - Use the `Delete Nodes` button to remove nodes from any materials still in the list.

    The Hybrid approach allows you to ensure that the automatic deletion does not remove important nodes.

!!! tip "Tips"
    - The `Clear List` button (:fontawesome-regular-trash-can: icon) clears all materials from the list, allowing you to start fresh.
    - Use the `Highlight Nodes` checkbox to easily spot the found nodes.

### Batch Rename

> Location: 3D Viewport ▸ BatchGenie N-Panel ▸ Utilities

While not an all-encompassing renaming tool, this function provides targeted assistance for a few specific use cases. It includes options for aligning mesh names with object names and syncing image names with their file names, making it particularly useful when dealing imported Assets that have inconsistent naming conventions.

=== "Set Mesh names same as Object names"
    ![Batch Rename Utility](images/utility_batch-rename-1.png){ .img-box align=left }

    <h5>Options</h5>

    - **Selection**: Allows you to specify which objects to include in the batch run:
        - **All Objects**
        - **Objects marked as Assets**
        - **Objects NOT marked as Assets**
        - **Selected Objects**

=== "Set Image names same as the Image File names"
    ![Batch Rename Utility](images/utility_batch-rename-2.png){ .img-box align=left }



=== "Set Material names same as Object names"
    ![Batch Rename Utility](images/utility_batch-rename-3.png){ .img-box align=left }

    <h5>Options</h5>

    - **Selection**: Allows you to specify which objects to include in the batch run:
        - **All Objects**
        - **Objects marked as Assets**
        - **Objects NOT marked as Assets**
        - **Selected Objects**
    - **Naming Options**:
        - **Add as Prefix**: Adds the object name as a prefix to the material name (e.g., `ObjectName_OriginalMaterialName`).
        - **Add as Suffix**: Adds the object name as a suffix to the material name ( (e.g., `OriginalMaterialName_ObjectName`).
        - **Complete Rename**: Replace the material name with the object name.


??? abstract "Examples"
    **Set Mesh names same as Object names**:

    ![Batch Rename Mesh Example](images/utility_batch_rename_mesh_example.gif){ .img-box }

    **Set Image names same as the Image File names**:

    **Use Case**: You imported external models, and all texture names are generic like 'color map', 'roughness map', and 'normal map', making it difficult to track them. This feature solves the issue by renaming image names in Blender to match the actual file names. For example, instead of 'color map', it could be 'Bark_2K_BaseColor'.

    ![Batch Rename Texture Example](images/utility_batch_rename_texture_example.gif){ .img-box }

### Relink Converted Images

> Location: 3D Viewport ▸ BatchGenie N-Panel ▸ Utilities

This utility helps you update Blender's links to images that have been converted to a different file format. When image files are converted (e.g., from `Png` or `Tif` to `Jpg` or `Webp`) to save disk space or optimize performance, Blender may lose track of the original image links due to the change in file extensions. This utility automatically relinks the converted images by searching for the corresponding files and updating their links based on customizable conditions.

![Relink Converted Images Utility](images/utility_relink-converted-images.png){ .img-box align=left }

<h5>Options</h5>

- **Old Format**: Select the file format you are converting from. The supported formats in Blender include: `Png, Jpg, Jpeg, Tga, Webp, Exr, Tif, Tiff, Bmp, Sgi, Rgb, Bw, Jp2, J2c, Cin, Dpx, Hdr`.
- **New Format**: Choose the file format you are converting to. The available formats match those listed for the "Old Format".
- **File Verification**:
    - **Verify if old file exists**: Ensures that the old file exists before attempting to relink.
    - **Link if old file does not exist**: This option will only link the new file if the old file is missing.
    - **Always link new file**: Links the new file regardless of whether the old file is found.
    - **Skip relink if old file exists**: Skips the relinking process if the old file still exists.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

#### - Add Tags {#Asset-tags-add}

=== "Default Tag"
    ![Tag - Default or Copy Tag](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_default.gif){ .img-box align=left }

    - **New Tag**: Creates a regular tag.
    - **Copy from existing tags**: Lets you pick from a dropdown menu containing all tags from the currently selected Assets. Tags that are present in all of the selected Assets are filtered out (since it wouldn't make sense to apply a tag that is already there).

=== "Object Triangles"
    ![Tag - Object Triangles](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_triangles.gif){ .img-box align=left }

    Tags Object Assets with their triangle count, offering customizable formatting and rounding options to suit your needs. Examples illustrate the tag's appearance based on your selections before applying them.

=== "Object Vertices"
    ![Tag - Object Vertices](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_vertices.gif){ .img-box align=left }

    Tags Object Assets with their vertex count, offering customizable formatting and rounding options to suit your needs. Examples illustrate the tag's appearance based on your selections before applying them.

=== "Object / Collection Dimensions"
    ![Tag - Object and Collection Dimensions](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_collection_dimensions.gif){ .img-box align=left }

    Adds Tags displaying the size or dimensions of objects and collections. You can customize the format and adjust options such as decimal precision and unit display. The interface provides an example to preview how the tags will appear based on your selected settings.

=== "Material Texture Resolution"
    ![Tag - Material Texture Resolution](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_material_texture_resolution.png){ .img-box align=left }

    Tags material Assets with the texture resolution, like 2K, 4K, or 8K, by identifying the albedo texture within the material and checking its resolution.

=== "Material Type"
    ![Tag - Material Type](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_material_type.gif){ .img-box align=left }

    Tags material Assets with its type: "Texture-based" or "Procedural", with an option to include node counts for both types.


!!! tip "Tip"
    Smart Tags will overwrite previously existing Smart Tags of the same type. For example, if you have added the Object Dimensions tag and then edited the object, you can reapply the tag to update it.


#### - Combine / Split Tags {#Asset-tags-combine-split}

![Tag - Combine and Split](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_combine_split.gif){ .img-box align=left }

Combine or split existing tags on Assets. Combine single-word tags into a single line, separated by commas (e.g., "tag1, tag2, tag3"), only if they don't contain spaces.

The split function reverses this, separating combined tags that follow the exact "tag1, tag2, tag3" format. Tags with spaces, like "Long tag with spaces" are unaffected by either function.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

#### - Remove Tags {#Asset-tags-remove}

=== "Existing"
    ![Tag - Object Triangles](images/utility_asset_browser_remove_tags_existing.png){ .img-box align=left }

    Displays all tags from the currently selected Assets in the Asset Browser in a dropdown menu, allowing you to choose which tags to remove.

    You also have filtering options to only show common tags from the selected Assets, as well as an "Exclude common" option to exclude these tags.

=== "Keyword"
    ![Tag - Object Triangles](images/utility_asset_browser_remove_tags_keyword.png){ .img-box align=left }

    Allows you to search for tags using a keyword with options for "exact," "contains," "starts with," or "ends with," along with a "case sensitive" option to precisely target specific tags.

=== "Smart Tags"
    ![Tag - Object Triangles](images/utility_asset_browser_remove_tags_smart_tags.png){ .img-box align=left }

    Allows you to target specific Smart Tags applied by BatchGenie for safe removal without affecting other types of tags.

!!! tip "Tip"
    You can also access the Tags menu through the right-click menu in the Asset Browser.

### Asset Metadata

> Location: Asset Browser ▸ BatchGenie Menu

Batch add metadata for your Assets: Description, License, Copyright, and Author. You can select and edit one or multiple attributes simultaneously. This feature works with both internal and external assets, so you don't have to open each individual Asset Blend file separately.

If a single Asset is selected, you can use the "Retrieve from Selected Asset" button to load its existing metadata for editing.

![Metadata Utility](images/utility_asset_browser_metadata.png){ .img-box align=left }

!!! tip "Tip"
    You can also access the Metadata menu through the right-click menu in the Asset Browser.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

### Move Assets

> Location: Asset Browser ▸ BatchGenie Menu

Move Assets to different Asset Catalogs to help you organize your Asset Library. This feature works with both internal and external Assets, so you don't have to open each individual Asset Blend file separately.

The 'Catalog Details' section displays the UUID and the Asset Library Path of the chosen Catalog.

![Move Assets Utility](images/utility_move_assets.png){ .img-box align=left }

![Move Assets Catalog Example](images/utility_move_assets_catalog_example.png){ .img-box align=left }

<h5>Instructions</h5>
First, make sure you're in the specific Asset library where you want to move your assets. Once that's done, select the assets you want to move, choose the destination, and click OK.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

!!! info2 "How is this done?"

    The utility does not touch the Assets "physical location"; it simply changes the Catalog ID they are associated with, making them appear in a specific catalog (exactly as if you had moved them manually).

### Load previews from disk

> Location: Asset Browser ▸ BatchGenie Menu ▸ Misc

Load custom Asset Preview images from a specified directory. When assets are selected in the Asset Browser, this tool checks for image files in the selected folder that match the names of the assets.

Supports all image formats that are natively supported by Blender. The tool prioritizes common formats in the following order: `Png`, `Jpg`, `Jpeg`, `Tga`, `Webp`, `Exr`, `Tif`, `Tiff`, and `Bmp`. It stops searching once a matching image is found. If you need support for less common formats (`Sgi`, `Rgb`, `Bw`, `Jp2`, `J2c`, `Cin`, `Dpx`, `Hdr`), ensure [Use Extended Formats](preferences.md#import) is enabled in the BatchGenie Preferences.

![Load Asset Previews from disk](images/utilities_asset_browser_misc.png){ .img-box align=left }

<h5>Instructions</h5>

1. Select the Assets you want to load previews for in the Asset Browser.
- Navigate to `BatchGenie > Misc > Load previews from disk`.

### Pack Textures

> Location: Asset Browser ▸ BatchGenie Menu ▸ Misc

This utility packs all associated textures into their respective blend files, ensuring that your assets retain their appearance without the need for external texture files.

![Load Asset Previews from disk](images/utilities_asset_browser_misc.png){ .img-box align=left }

!!! warning "Note"
    This feature packs textures for all Assets inside the blend file, which can affect other Assets that you have not selected but reside in the same blend file as one of the selected Assets.

<h5>Instructions</h5>

1. Select the Assets you want to pack from the Asset Browser.
- Navigate to `BatchGenie > Misc > Pack Textures`.

<div style="clear:both"></div>


### Export Asset Details to Excel

> Location: Asset Browser ▸ BatchGenie Menu ▸ Misc

## Single Operation Utilities

### Replace Node

> Location: Shader Editor ▸ BatchGenie N-Panel

This utility offers similar functionality to the [Replace Shader Nodes](#replace-shader-nodes) utility but is designed for processing individual nodes rather than batch adjustments. It also allows you to replace any type of node, not just the main shader node as in the main utility.

<h5>Settings</h5>

- **Target**:
    - **Main Shader**: Targets the main shader connected to the 'Material Output' inside the material.
    - **Active Node**: Select a node manually.
- **Keep Original Node**: Check this option if you want to retain the original node for manual inspection of the connections afterward. The original node will be moved to the side of the replaced node.
- **Replacement Node-Group**: Select the custom Node-Group to replace the shader from a dropdown menu displaying all Node-Groups in the current blend file.
- **Custom Attributes**: Set one or multiple socket attributes such as color or values on the new node. See [this section](import_textures.md/#custom-attributes) in the documentation for detailed instructions.
